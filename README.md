# Project Title:
## Given a movie review, predict the rating given by the reviewer.(Sentiment Analysis)

### In this problem, we will use the Naive Bayes algorithm for text classification. The dataset for this problem is a subset of the IMDB movie review dataset and has been obtained from [this_website](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).A review comes from one of the
eight categories (class label).Here, class label represents rating given by the user along with the review. Dataset is provided in four files i) Train text ii) Train labels iii) Test text iv) Test labels. Text files contain one
review in each line and label files contain the corresponding rating.
